## Technical Details

### 1. VPN Configuration
The app uses the following server details for the SSL/TLS WebSocket tunnel:
- **Server**: 172.67.187.6
- **Port**: 443
- **Username**: tnl-otm3uubm
- **Password**: 4UWTvugbWNRO
- **SNI**: ssh-de-2.optnl.com
- **Payload**: Configured as a WebSocket upgrade request in `lib/services/vpn_service.dart`.

### 2. Supabase Setup
- Run the SQL in `supabase_schema.sql` in your Supabase project.
- Update `lib/main.dart` with your project URL and Anon Key.

### 3. Android Build (APK size < 40MB)
This project is configured to build **split-per-ABI** release APKs (smaller than a universal APK).

Build:
```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

Ensure the package name in `lib/services/vpn_service.dart` (`com.example.cdn_netshare`) matches your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Setup
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Voice/Video Calling (WebRTC)
This build includes a simple **self-hosted** WebSocket signaling server (no Supabase involvement):

```bash
cd signaling-server
npm install
npm run start
```

- Default server: `ws://0.0.0.0:8787`
- The app currently uses **Android emulator default**: `ws://10.0.2.2:8787`
  - For a real device, change it to your PC/LAN IP, e.g. `ws://192.168.1.10:8787`

> Note: WebRTC call reliability may require TURN for some networks.


## Media auto-delete (Supabase Storage)
Media (images/voice) are uploaded to the `chat_media` bucket but **auto-deleted after `expires_at`**.

This build ships an Edge Function `cleanup_media` (already deployed). You should schedule it (e.g. every 10 minutes) in Supabase Dashboard:
- **Edge Functions → cleanup_media → Schedules** (Cron)
- Suggested cron: `*/10 * * * *`

What it does:
- Finds messages where `media_path` is set and `expires_at < now()`.
- Deletes the object from Storage bucket `chat_media`.
- Sets `media_path/media_mime/media_duration_ms` to NULL so Storage stops being used.
- The message stays in chat; clients will show cached local copy if available.
